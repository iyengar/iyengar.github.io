      I've got to get something off my chest. I love Instagram. I'll spend 15
      minutes getting my dinner setting just right so I can heavily saturate
      the colors on my (rapidly cooling) fettucini alfredo and blur out the wine
      glass in the background. My friends all make fun of me for it. I don't care.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
      I download a lot of iPhone apps.  I like to see what people are building.
      Instagram is one of the few that I actually use regularly.  Is it really
      worth a billion dollars?  Probably.  I don't know.  Doesn't matter.  This
      post isn't about that.  It's about the next wave of content creation.

      Instagram makes it easy to create high quality content.  I like taking
      pictures.  I don't own an SLR camera.  I don't know a whole lot about
      photography.  My Instagrams still come out pretty nice.  They're not the
      best.  They never end up on the popular page.  But, I like them.
      Sometimes my friends like them.  And that's enough to keep me using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My (very) limited photography knowledge boils down to two key concepts:
      composition and exposure.  Both easily controlled by Instagram without
      even understanding their significance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/10-top-photography-composition-rules">
          Composition</a> controls the subject.  There are many composition
        rules Instagram can't control, but requiring a square crop on photos
        forces you to trim out the noise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.org/2011/general-photography-articles/learn-photography/the-three-basics-of-photography/">
          Exposure</a> controls the lighting.  I don't fully understand shutter
        speed, aperture and ISO, but Instagram makes that easy to fake with
        blur, filters and
        <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/17436816889/instagram-tips-using-lux">Lux</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">
      <em>[Aside:  This also illustrates why an "Instagram for Video" is not so
        simple. Video is a much more complex medium - creation is harder and
        consumption is harder.  Composition is harder because it takes longer to
        sift through raw footage.  Exposure is harder because you have to deal
        with movement.  And it adds another dimension - audio.  Even once you've
        solved those problems, video requires more time to consume and is harder
        to share.]

      User activation is easy for Instagram because its useful as a standalone
      tool. You don't need to build a social network before it becomes
      compelling. Just install it and start making all your photos look like they
      were taken in the 70's.  I've met plenty of people who don't follow any
      friends.  (That is, until I take their phone and force them to follow me.
      <a href="http://instagram.com/iyengar">@iyengar</a>.  Do it.)

      But we all crave recognition.  Once you've crafted an amazing photo of your
      dinner, you want people to see it.  Instagram leads to very natural sharing
      &mdash; people inherently want to show off what they create.

      Plus, tweeting "At the beach on a Tuesday #nbd" isn't as satisfying as
      Instagramming your sexy legs to really rub in in everyone's face.  And then
      tweeting the picture.

      The Internet is very hit driven.  Everyone is bombarded by the breakout
      winners (think Gangnam Style) until they're sick of them.  That also means
      novelty commands a premium &mdash; if it's high quality.

      Instagram photos are a constant stream of unique content that hasn't been
      seen anywhere else.  On a recent road trip, my friend
      <a href="https://twitter.com/rypan">Ryan</a> and I took Instagrams from the
      exact same spot at the same time.  We ended up with completely unique
      perspectives on the same location.

      Flickr and YouTube solved the aggregation and hosting problem for
      user-generated content. Instagram solves the problem of creating that
      content in the first place.  In the process, it also became a destination
      for content consumption.  This makes it more valuable and more sustainable
      than platforms that depend on content from other sources.  It seems like
      Mark Zuckerburg agrees.  Users were already posting their Instagrams to
      Facebook, but owning the source gives you full control the golden content
      goose.

      There are many more of these to come.
      <a href="http://beautylish.polyvore.com/">Polyvore</a> is another great
      example of this model.  I'm excited about how these tools will make the
      next wave of content easy to create, high-quality, unique and endless.
