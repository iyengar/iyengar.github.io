    <h1>What College Doesn't Teach You About Being Effective at Work</h1>
    <div class="date">June 2009</div>

    <p>
      There's a lot of things about being effective at work that college doesn't
      teach you.  At the risk of sounding like a corporate drone (but a highly
      efficient corporate drone!), here are some that I've found useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Document everything.</strong> Have easily-accessible references
      for everything you've done (plans, presentations, decisions, notes,
      designs, etc.).   It helps you stay focused and helps other people
      understand what you're doing.  Next time someone asks you a question about
      your project, you'll already have plenty of things to point them to.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Communicate.</strong> I've found it better to err on the side of
      over-communication, its helpful to everyone you work with.  Similarly,
      being responsive is also important: a short reply like "I'm looking into
      it" or "Looks good to me" is better than leaving the person wondering if
      you even got their e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Know key metrics and industry trends.</strong> This one will be
      useful when you least expect it.  Understanding some numbers (at least to
      an order of magnitude) can help you prioritize and make better decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Make an agenda.</strong> Everyone has attended plenty of
      directionless and inefficient meetings.  Don't be the reason they have to
      attend one more.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Try it.</strong> It's easier to evaluate an idea when you have a
      public proof-of-concept that people can give you feedback on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Know your priorities and your accomplishments.</strong> This one is
      more important than I thought.  When you work on something every day,  it's
      easy for it to seem routine and to lose sight of (for lack of a better
      phrase) "the big-picture".  Having your priorities top of mind helps you
      ensure that you're making an impact.  Knowing your accomplishments helps
      people understand what that impact is.
