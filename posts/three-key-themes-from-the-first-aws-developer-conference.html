    <p>
      Amazon pulled out all the stops to throw their first Amazon Web Services
      (AWS) developers conference last week.  Here are three key themes I
      noticed from the talks they scheduled to fill the time between the laser
      light shows, delicious food and abundant drinks.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Design for failure (and simulate failures)</h3>
    <p>
      I lost count of how many speakers stressed the need to be in multiple
      availability zones.  This is easy to do, and is even easier if you start
      this from the beginning rather than trying to migrate later on.  The last
      few EC2 outages resulted in
      <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/22/amazon-cloud-outage-takes-down-reddit-airbnb-flipboard-more/">downtime for many popular sites</a>
      and some bad publicity for AWS.  In response, the team is making it clear
      that machine failures are expected and
      <strong>a redundant architecture is required</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, regularly testing failure cases avoids surprises when
      they happen in real life.  Two strategies:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Closely mirror your development environment to your production
        configuration and test machine failure and upgrades regularly.
      </li>
      <li>Simulate failure in your production systems.  For example, take down
        all the machines in one availability zone and ensure that everything is
        still working.  Netflix has a great tool called
        <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki">ChaosMonkey</a>
        that makes it easy to run "fire drills" like this.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Automate (and monitor) everything</h3>
    <p>
      The obvious advantage of cloud computing is the ability to scale capacity to
      meet demand.  <strong>The hidden advantage is the ability to do this
        automatically.</strong> For example,
      <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Auto Scaling</a> allows you to
      automatically launch and terminate new EC2 instances based on defined
      metrics or on a recurring schedule. This creates an architecture that can
      respond to unexpected user access patterns the same way that a redundant
      architecture can automatically respond to unexpected machine failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example of how to utilize swing capacity is for deployment.
      Rather than update existing machines, launch a new cluster of machines with
      the new code and point traffic to them.  Rolling back is as simple as
      pointing traffic back to the old machines.  If everything is working, tear
      down the old ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has two implications for monitoring:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Careful performance monitoring is the best weapon in architecture
        tuning. The challenge is to identify the right configuration for your
        application. The logistical and financial headache of transitioning to
        that configuration no longer exists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers can factor in cost as part of the optimization process.  This
        is especially advantageous to startups that need to manage cashflow.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. Data, Data, Data</h3>
    <p>
      Immediate access to large amounts of processing and storage capability has
      always appealed to data enthusiasts, but its clear that companies are
      making serious progress in this area.  For example, Netflix has built a
      data processing architecture in which
      <strong>S3 is their "data warehouse"</strong> and EMR jobs run when they
      need to interact with the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many best practices around the extraction and transform stages
      of a data warehouse pipeline (essentially, save everything to S3 and use
      EMR).  I'm excited to see more progress in the later two stages &mdash;
      warehousing and analytics.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Warehousing: Treating S3 as a data warehouse is clever but makes on the
        fly queries difficult.  Amazon's
        <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Redshift</a> aims to fill this
        gap with a more traditional data warehouse product.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analytics: This is the area that I'm most excited for given how
        cumbersome it is to generate customized reports and charts.  Most
        companies that aren't using a traditional enterprise solution like
        MicroStrategy have had to invest considerable energy to roll their
        own solution.
      </li>
    </ol>
