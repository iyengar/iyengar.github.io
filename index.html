    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    I'm a strong believer in education and I enjoy teaching:
    <ul>
      <li>I taught Intro to Computer Science at Balboa High school in Fall 2014 as part of
        <a href="http://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a>.</li>
      <li>I mentor low-income, high-achieving high school students with
        <a href="http://www.mindsmattersf.org/">Minds Matter of San Francisco</a>.</li>
      <li>I was a teaching assistant for <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa06/">
          CS 61C</a> the third introductory CS class at UC Berkeley in Fall 2006.
        You can watch a younger, more handsome version of me give a lecture about
        <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/stream.php?type=real&amp;webcastid=16336">networking</a>.
      </li>
      <li>I helped develop the <a href="http://wla.berkeley.edu">Weiner Lecture Archives</a>,
        an archive of UC Berkeley CS lectures and corresponding lecture notes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Publications</h3>
    I was a Graduate Student at UC Berkeley.  My research focused on using wireless
    sensor networks for healthcare applications.

        Online since 1999 - My first project was a site that linked to popular Java games.
        Thanks to the internet archive, you can still see what an
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991001054537/http://sameer.8m.com/">early version</a>
        and a
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011024022229/yenga.hypermart.net/games/">
          later revision</a> looked like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Notizi: Social RSS reader that recommended news articles based on things a
        user's friends liked.  I co-founded Notizi along with Casey Ho.
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52LvxJH79vw">Watch a screencast</a>
        of one of our early versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smartizen: Application that determined a representatives stance on major issues
        by analyzing their voting record in congress.  We tagged bills into major topic
        areas and displayed how each representative voted on bills in that topic.
